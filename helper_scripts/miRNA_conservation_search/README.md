# miRNA conservation search
To perform a blast search of the miRNAs, run the **'run_conservation_search.sh'** script. This will download the genomes specified in 'get_references_acanthamoeba.sh' and 'get_references_dictyostelia.sh', followed by a blast search for the miRNA-5p and miRNA-3p sequences provided in 'miRNAs_withstar.fa'. The filtered output results will be in bed format, located in acanthamoeba/bed/ and dictyostelia/bed/ for the acanthamoebae and dictyostelids respectively. <br />
In the output you are expected to find all the miRNAs from that given organism, as well as any conserved from other organisms, e.g. in the resulting 'dictyostelia/bed/d_discoideum.bed' output there should be all the *D. discoideum* miRNAs, as well as *D. firmibasis* dfi-mir-1177. There are also some hits for the dfa-mir-1220 miRNA, however these are false positives (are not visibly conserved from dfa-mir-1220, no expression of small RNAs, do not form a hairpin) which is why the results need to be manually curated. <br />
Prerequisites: Blast, R, bash
